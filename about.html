            <p class="featured-body"> 
            <span id="starting-line">I used to be a pack rat,</span>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. </p>
            
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3> How I turned things around</h3>
            <p> <span id="starting-line">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. </span>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
            </p>

            <h3>Now I live the simple life </h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p> With how much it turned my life around, <span id="starting-line">I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</span> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
